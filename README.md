⭐ C++ Project Repository – By Hasham Hassan

Welcome to my C++ practice and project hub!
This repository contains some of my C++ programs, from basic concepts to complete real-world mini-systems, created while learning, experimenting, and sharpening my development skills.

🚀 About This Repository

This repo is a compilation of C++ projects I built to strengthen my logic, improve my OOP skills, and understand how real systems work behind the scenes.

You will find:

✔ Fully functional management systems

✔ Logical + mathematical programs

✔ Data-structure-based implementations

✔ Complete console-based applications

✔ Clean, simple, and beginner-friendly code

🧠 What I Have Built

Here are some of the main systems included in this repository:

🔹 Hostel Management System

Handles student entries, room allocation, records, and overall hostel operations using structures, arrays, and file handling.

🔹 Hotel Management System

A menu-driven system that manages customer check-ins, check-outs, billing, room services, and more.

🔹 Student Management System

Stores, updates, deletes, and displays student data using functions, structures, and search algorithms.

🔹 Train Seat Booking System

Simulates a train reservation system with seat status, booking, cancellation, and viewing options.

🔹 + Many More C++ Practice Codes

From arrays, functions, loops, pointers, recursion, classes, file handling, and OOP  everything is included as part of my learning journey
Library Management System.....
